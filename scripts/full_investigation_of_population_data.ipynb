    "2) There is a big jump or drop in some countries' population time series between 2005 and 2011. Instead of bias adjusting the future or historic time series, it seems that the dataset was merged by performing a linear interpolation between 2005-2011. \n",

    "# Spatial consistency of the dataset:\n",
    "Since we are now sure that national time series are correct for each country, we also need to check how this national population is distributed across gridcells.\n",
    "For example, Inne Valderkelen identified that there is a spatial inconsistency at the transition year 2005-2006, between the historic and ssp2 dataset.\n",
    "The spatial inconsistency consist in the fact, that some gridcell time series experience a sudden drop or jump at the transition year (e.g. from 0 to 100000 people in one year).\n",
    "This is an unrealistic behavior, making it impossible to use for analysis on gridcell level, and putting under question model results which were generated using this data.\n",
    "\n",
    "While a solution was already proposed for this specific issue, it is worth looking if there are no similar issues for the remaining of years.\n",
    "Also, to be more precise in our assessment of the spatial consistency, we will analyze this property at country level instead of global.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, we need an objective metric to estimate the spatial consistency between each consecutive years.\n",
    "For this scope, we propose the following metric:\n",
    "\n",
    "metric_spatial_consistency_for_given_country_and_transition_year(N-1) =  Sum_over_all_grids[absolute_value(gridded_country_pop_year(N) - gridded_country_pop_year(N-1))]/[absolute_value(aggregated_country_pop_year(N) - aggregated_country_pop_year(N-1))] \n",
    "\n",
    "Normally, we can expect the following behavior from this metric:\n",
    "1) If the weights of each gridcell for a given country, remain the same at the transition between the year N and N-1, then this metric will return 1. \n",
    "2) If the weights are changing, it means, that at the transition between year N and N-1, some grids gain population weight relatively to others in the same country. In this case the metric will return a value larger than 1. \n",
    "\n",
    "It should be mentioned that in theory, it is ok to have this metric > 1. Actually in reality, most of the time this will be the case, as human settlements in a given country can grow at different rates, which gradually is changing the grids weights with some places cumulating population faster or slower.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the same time, if we observe an anomaly in this metric, with a sudden change significantly exceeding the normal statistics, it is likely due to a problem with the data."
